# OpenRing Rules

## Projects

To avoid relearning the project structure when contributing to a new project, projects must have the same underlying structure which includes the same ruleset around contributions, releases, testing, commit guidelines etc. For this reason we MUST use [pristine](https://github.com/etclabscore/pristine) as a starting point for repositories. This is true for all repositories with the exception of `Rules` repository.

## Volunteering

This is an open ring of people so anyone is free to join and contribute to the projects.
